This code is written in MATLAB and requires the KNITRO solver. As is, the model replicates results found in the paper but parameters can be changed to explore other settings. Initial guesses for the solver are set near the solution to reduce run time.

### Instructions
The main file is `MAIN_SCRIPT.m`. At the top of the file, the user must indicate the location of the KNITRO options file using `options_file`. Next, the user selects the type of model to run using the `logic` structure. Setting `logic.stat_ems = 0` will run the model with non-stationary emissions following the DICE-2007 model. Setting `logic.ghkt = 1` will alter the carbon decay structure to match that of Golosov, Hassler, Krusell, and Tsyvinski (2014). `logic.hotelling` determines whether, for a given model, you will perform a run accounting for inertia in warming `logic.hotelling = 0` or not `logic.hotelling = 1`. When running the base model, setting `logic.vary_params = 1` will also solve the model for an inertia parameter that is 25% higher and lower, and then for a discount rate of 1.4% from Stern (2007). Note two things:

1. To perform a non-stationary emissions run, you must use the base decay structure, and to use the GHKT decay structure, you must have stationary emissions. If you attempt to run both together, the code will default to a GHKT model with stationary emissions.

2. You can only use the code to automatically vary discounting and the level of inertia for the base model in the main text. However, alternative parameterizations for the GHKT or non-stationary emissions models can be explored by hard coding changes to the parameter values.

Finally, the user must determine which temperature targets to loop over and solve the model. `params.first_temp` and `params.final_temp` determine the lowest and highest temperature target to use, and `params.temp_incr` determines the size of the increment in the temperature target as we loop from the lowest to the highest target.

### Results
`calculate_results_XXXX.m` where `XXXX` is either `ghkt` or `base` calculates the final results for the GHKT and base/non-stationary models found in the paper. The results are saved in a structure called `output`. The script saves the results to model-specific folders with file names that indicate the temperature target (or temperature target equivalent); whether it is a Hotelling run or not; and in the case of the base model, the value of the inertia parameter and the discount rate.

### How the algorithms work
We solve all the models using reverse-shooting style algorithms (see Judd (1998)). We use the necessary conditions to pin down as many terminal conditions as possible and then search over the free terminal conditions that yield the correct initial conditions at a given point in the simulation which varies depending on the model type. Here we take the terminal time to be the time at which the policymaker hits the temperature constraint. After the constraint is hit the policymaker simply abates to maintain the constraint, so the problem is fully determined beyond this time. As with most optimal control problems, the problem is significantly more stable when run in reverse time so we solve the system of ordinary differential equations backwards.

#### Base model (main text)
For the base Hotelling model, we do not need to search over free terminal conditions. Here we have one CO2 state and one CO2 costate. The temperature target pins down the CO2 state at the terminal time. The target also implies that CO2 cannot be changing at the terminal time, so the velocity of CO2 must be zero, which implies the level of abatement at the terminal time must be the level that maintains CO2 equal to the target. This level of abatement then implies the CO2 costate from the maximality condition. All the terminal conditions are accounted for and the system can simply be simulated in reverse.

The base inertia model follows the same logic as the base Hotelling model. The target pins down terminal temperature and CO2, when then pins down terminal abatement and the terminal CO2 costate. however the temperature costate at the terminal time is free. We simulate the system in reverse until the simulated CO2 stock is equal to the parameterized initial CO2 stock, call this time `t0`. We solve the problem by searching over the terminal temperature costate with the objective equating the initial temperature parameter to the simulated temperature at time `t0`.

#### GHKT decay model (appendix)
For the GHKT model we now have two CO2 stocks, but still one constraint on the sum of CO2 stocks. For the Hotelling model, the target pins down the sum of the two CO2 stocks, so now we must also search over the terminal value of one of the CO2 stocks. We search for the terminal value of the permanent CO2 stock, although it could be done for the geometrically decaying stock as well. The value of the terminal permanent CO2 stock implies the terminal geometrically decaying stock, and also terminal abatement since terminal abatement must maintain the total level of CO2 at its steady state level. Terminal abatement implies the value of the CO2 constraint Lagrange multiplier from the maximality condition, which then implies the two terminal CO2 costates before they jump, from the adjoint equations and the relationship between the constraint Lagrange multiplier and the jump multipliers for each CO2 costate. We simulate the system in reverse until the simulated permanent CO2 stock is equal to the parameterized initial permanent CO2 stock, call this time `t0`. To solve the problem we search over the terminal permanent CO2 stock with the objective equating the initial geometrically decaying CO2 stock parameter to the simulated geometrically decaying CO2 stock at `t0`.

The GHKT inertia model again follows the same logic with one twist. As with the base model, the temperature target pins down terminal temperature and now we must also search over the terminal temperature costate. But now, we simulate the system in reverse until the simulated permanent CO2 stock is equal to the parameterized initial permanent CO2 stock, or until we reach full abatement since the negative emissions constraint may bind. If this happens, we continue simulating backwards at full abatement until we find a time when the negative emissions constraint's Lagrange multiplier is zero, with its differential equation coming from the time derivative of the maximality condition. Next, we continue to simulate the now unconstrained problem in reverse until the simulated permanent CO2 stock is equal to the parameterized initial permanent CO2 stock at time `t0`. To solve the problem, we search over the terminal permanent CO2 stock and terminal temperature costate with the objective of equating the initial temperature parameter to the simulated temperature at `t0`, and equating the initial geometrically decaying CO2 stock parameter to the simulated geometrically decaying CO2 stock at `t0`.

#### Non-stationary emissions model (appendix)
For the non-stationary emissions setting, we must search over the terminal time at which we hit the target. As with the base Hotelling model, the target pins down the terminal CO2 stock. However, unlike the base model, this alone does not pin down abatement since we must know the level of emissions at the terminal time to know the level of terminal abatement and in turn the terminal CO2 costate. Therefore, we simulate the model in reverse until the simulated CO2 level at the initial time of the simulation implied by the guessed terminal time, again call this `t0`. We then search over the terminal time with the objective equating the initial CO2 parameter to the simulated CO2 level at `t0`.

The inertia model follows the same logic as the Hotelling model but now, the temperature target pins down terminal temperature and now we must also search over the terminal temperature costate. We add another objective of equating the initial temperature parameter to the simulated temperature at `t0`.
